# NLP Projects Repository

This repository contains multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects organized into the following folders:

## Project Structure

- **NLP_1**:
  
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
Text Representation: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.
Text Classification: Using machine learning models to classify text data.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing the sentiment of text data.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying entities in text.

- **NLP_3**:

This project automates the process of screening resumes using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to filter and rank resumes based on predefined criteria, making the recruitment process more efficient and effective.

- **NLP_4**:

This notebook demonstrates various techniques for tokenizing and tagging text using Python's NLTK and spaCy libraries. The goal is to explore different methods for breaking down text into words and sentences, as well as removing stop words.



Each folder contains individual README files with detailed information about their respective projects, code, and usage instructions.
